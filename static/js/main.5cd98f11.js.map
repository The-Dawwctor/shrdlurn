Our goal is to allow people access to the power of programming languages without conforming to uncompromising syntax. NRC does this by interactively learning from its user starting from a precise programming language.\"\n\t                    ),\n\t                    _react2.default.createElement(\n\t                        \"h2\",\n\t                        null,\n\t                        \"Get started\"\n\t                    ),\n\t                    _react2.default.createElement(\n\t                        \"ul\",\n\t                        null,\n\t                        _react2.default.createElement(\n\t                            \"li\",\n\t                            null,\n\t                            \" Go to the \",\n\t                            _react2.default.createElement(\n\t                                _reactRouter.Link,\n\t                                { to: \"/build\" },\n\t                                \"build page\"\n\t                            ),\n\t                            \" and type \\\"add red 1 4 5\\\" \"\n\t                        ),\n\t                        _react2.default.createElement(\n\t                            \"li\",\n\t                            null,\n\t                            \" NRC always understands the \",\n\t                            _react2.default.createElement(\n\t                                \"a\",\n\t                                { target: \"_blank\", href: _strings.DOCUMENTATION_URL },\n\t                                \"core language\"\n\t                            ),\n\t                            \", which has a fixed syntax.\"\n\t                        ),\n\t                        _react2.default.createElement(\n\t                            \"li\",\n\t                            null,\n\t                            \" You can define \\\"add ball 1 4 5\\\" by clicking the \\\"Define this\\\" button and entering \\\"add red 1 4 5\\\".
